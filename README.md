# View your webcam in a browser 

Why would you want to do this? In some video conferencing software (e.g., Google Meet) screen sharing a browser tab allows much faster video than screen sharing an application window. By using this simple project, you will be able to broadcast your webcam to a tab, then share that tab for smooth video playback. Example: Create a virtual webcam in OBS, display it in a browser tab then share that tab in Google Meet for fast playback.

## Usage
Make sure python3 is available:

```
python3 -m http.server
```

or run `start.sh` which simply runs the command above.

Right click to select video device if you have multiple connected.
